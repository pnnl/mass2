High Priority:

    * check the id of a scalar source specification to make sure it
      has not already been specified

    * arbitrary id's in the scalar source specification, instead of
      consecutive integers

    * Open boundary condition for scalars that somehow understands
      flow reversal

    * utility to extract and integrate flows, velocities, temperature,
      and concentration along the border of a group of cells,
      e.g. the average concentration along the spillway at the
      downstream end of the grid. (partially done with mass2flux.pl)

    * Cartesian wind shear.

    * Supply a concentration with a volume source.

    * Limit the time frame for which output is produced; supply a list
      of output times

Low Priority:

    * get parallel version working again; use Global Arrays 

    * utility to plot gage.nc directly -- perhaps some combination of
      perl script and gnuplot, maybe even with a GUI like pTk.

    * add the capability to specify a non-point contaminant source
      that avoids the bed; this could be implemented by just using a
      different keyword (instead of BEDSOUCE) in scalar_source.dat

    * Open or radiant boundary condition.

Wetting/Drying Issues:

    * Check for "dry" cells when applying a scalar boundary condition.

    * Test scalars and wetting and drying, particularly TDG and
      temperature. 

    * check to see how dead zones affect mass source

Code Clean Up:

    * put the configuration files in CVS

    * configuration should use the CGNS macros from TE2THYS/PT6 

    * get rid of NetCDF; put gage output in text files?

    * check time series input to make sure it covers the entire
      simulation period

    * put the transient CGNS stuff back in (for visit)

    * change CGNS output variables to standard names (for visit)

Wish List:

    * Graphical user interface

    * the transport test cases should be transport only for the most
      part

    * simple eddy viscosity model ala Zhou

BUGS

    * when a scalar bed source is included in a cell that has a held
      concentration boundary, the source is cut in half.  This cropped
      up when ghost cells were added.  Until this is fixed, do not
      apply scalar bed sources to boundary cells.

    * Large block sizes can cause a silent SEGV on Linux systems
      because the stack is too small.  For example, the ap, ae, aw,
      an, as, bp, and source arrays in uvel_solve will not be usable.
      One has to increase the allowable stack size before running.
      It would probably be better to allocate them in each call.  

    * hydro_solve() and scalar_solve() declare several arrays that end
      up on the stack.  This causes a SEGV for large blocks when the
      shell stacksize limit is small.  These arrays should probably be
      allocated, but that might be slow.  

    * CGNS output in transport only mode cause a SEGV.

    * Visit doesn't like cell-centered CGNS output.  Why?
