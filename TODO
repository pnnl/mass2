High Priority:

    * check for file existance for all files opened

    * BC and other tables: either (1) make sure that the beginning and
      ending dates are within the simulation, and crash if not, or (2)
      just use the first/last values before/after table start/end.

    * utility to extract data from a single point in the plot.nc file

    * utility to extract and integrate flows, velocities, temperature,
      and concentration along the border of a group of cells,
      e.g. the average concentration along the spillway at the
      downstream end of the grid.

Low Priority:

    * split up the main module

    * utility to plot gage.nc directly -- perhaps some combination of
      perl script and gnuplot, maybe even with a GUI like pTk.
