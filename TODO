High Priority:

    * faster, Faster, FASTER

    * documentation? (yea right)

    * check the id of a scalar source specification to make sure it
      has not already been specified

    * arbitrary id's in the scalar source specification, instead of
      consecutive integers

    * check for file existance for all files opened

    * BC and other tables: either (1) make sure that the beginning and
      ending dates are within the simulation, and crash if not, or (2)
      just use the first/last values before/after table start/end.

    * utility to extract and integrate flows, velocities, temperature,
      and concentration along the border of a group of cells,
      e.g. the average concentration along the spillway at the
      downstream end of the grid. (partially done with mass2flux.pl)

Low Priority:

    * utility to plot gage.nc directly -- perhaps some combination of
      perl script and gnuplot, maybe even with a GUI like pTk.

    * check through the source terms, and be sure we're consistent
      about using the previous time step, or previous iteration,
      concentrations  

    * internal mass balance check for contaminants

    * add the capability to specify a non-point contaminant source
      that avoids the bed; this could be implemented by just using a
      different keyword (instead of BEDSOUCE) in scalar_source.dat

    * get rid of the stupid multiple makefiles; the first step would
      be to eliminate the module files as intermediate targets; then a
      series of special targets could be used to set the target,
      compiler, and flags; condor compilation may also be included.
