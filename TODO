High Priority:

    * faster, Faster, FASTER

    * documentation: theory and user manual

    * check the id of a scalar source specification to make sure it
      has not already been specified

    * arbitrary id's in the scalar source specification, instead of
      consecutive integers

    * check for file existance for all files opened

    * BC and other tables: either (1) make sure that the beginning and
      ending dates are within the simulation, and crash if not, or (2)
      just use the first/last values before/after table start/end.

    * Open boundary condition for scalars that somehow understands
      flow reversal

    * utility to extract and integrate flows, velocities, temperature,
      and concentration along the border of a group of cells,
      e.g. the average concentration along the spillway at the
      downstream end of the grid. (partially done with mass2flux.pl)

    * Cartesian wind shear.

    * Supply a concentration with a volume source.

    * Limit the time frame for which output is produced

Low Priority:

    * utility to plot gage.nc directly -- perhaps some combination of
      perl script and gnuplot, maybe even with a GUI like pTk.

    * internal mass balance check for contaminants (SAC request)

    * add the capability to specify a non-point contaminant source
      that avoids the bed; this could be implemented by just using a
      different keyword (instead of BEDSOUCE) in scalar_source.dat

    * get rid of the stupid multiple makefiles; the first step would
      be to eliminate the module files as intermediate targets; then a
      series of special targets could be used to set the target,
      compiler, and flags; condor compilation may also be included.

    * Read all time series through a single module.

    * Open or radiant boundary condition.

Wetting/Drying Issues:

    * Check for "dry" cells when applying a scalar boundary condition.

    * Test scalars and wetting and drying, particularly TDG and
      temperature.
