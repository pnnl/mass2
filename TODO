High Priority:

    * faster, Faster, FASTER

    * documentation: theory and user manual

    * check the id of a scalar source specification to make sure it
      has not already been specified

    * arbitrary id's in the scalar source specification, instead of
      consecutive integers

    * Open boundary condition for scalars that somehow understands
      flow reversal

    * utility to extract and integrate flows, velocities, temperature,
      and concentration along the border of a group of cells,
      e.g. the average concentration along the spillway at the
      downstream end of the grid. (partially done with mass2flux.pl)

    * Cartesian wind shear.

    * Supply a concentration with a volume source.

    * Limit the time frame for which output is produced

Low Priority:

    * utility to plot gage.nc directly -- perhaps some combination of
      perl script and gnuplot, maybe even with a GUI like pTk.

    * add the capability to specify a non-point contaminant source
      that avoids the bed; this could be implemented by just using a
      different keyword (instead of BEDSOUCE) in scalar_source.dat

    * Open or radiant boundary condition.

Wetting/Drying Issues:

    * Check for "dry" cells when applying a scalar boundary condition.

    * Test scalars and wetting and drying, particularly TDG and
      temperature. 

BUGS

    * when a scalar bed source is included in a cell that has a held
      concentration boundary, the source is cut in half.  This cropped
      up when ghost cells were added.  Until this is fixed, do not
      apply scalar bed sources to boundary cells.
