William,

Here is the info to get the data.  It is on our CHL FTP site.  Specifics
are:

Host Name:  134.164.160.15
Host Type:  Automatic Detect
User ID:  chlguest
Password:  chl99wave

Once you are in scan to briggs subdirectory, then to NSF tsunami benchmarks.
There is a ReadMe file.  

Let me know if you have any problems.
