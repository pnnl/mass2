README File


Revised: 21 Dec 95
Added incident gages 1-4 for each case in Problem 2.  

Revised: 6 Dec 95
Revised RUN2A.TXT, RUN2B.TXT, and RUN2C.TXT files.  Runup had been incorrectly 
calculated.

Benchmark Problems #2 & #3 
International Workshop on Long Wave Runup Models
Friday Harbor, San Juan Island, WA
September 12-16, 1995

ASCII data files of measured data for each Problem are stored at this anonymous
FTP site. 

Problem #2, "Runup of Solitary Waves on a Circular Island" 

The wave-paddle trajectories are stored in file FDBK2ABC.TXT.  A total of 10
sec from 22 to 32 sec (25 Hz sampling rate) is listed for each case in units of cm. 
Four columns are labeled "Time," "Case A," "Case B," "Case C." 

The surface elevation time series for gages 1-4, 6, 9, 16, and 22 for cases A, B, 
and C are stored in files TS2A.TXT, TS2B.TXT, and TS2C.TXT, respectively.  
A total of 60 sec of data from 20 to 80 sec is included for each case for the four 
gages in units of meters.  Nine columns are labeled "Time, "G1_m", "G2_m", etc. 

The next three files contain the runup height distributions for Cases A, B, and C,
respectively. They are named RUN2A.TXT, RUN2B.TXT, and RUN2C.TXT. 
Each file has four columns of data named "Rad", "Deg", "Max Vert Runup, cm"
(Average of 2 runs), and "R/d" (runup normalized by water depth).  Note that the
24 values are not evenly spaced around the perimeter. Sixteen were evenly
spaced every 22.5 deg around the perimeter.  Four radial transects with uneven
spacing (i.e. 2.5 and 5.0 deg) were located on the back side of the island (i.e. 90
deg) to improve the resolution in this critical area.

Problem #3, "Runup of Solitary Waves on a Vertical Wall" 

The wave-paddle trajectories are stored in file FDBK3ABC.TXT.  A total of 10
sec from 22 to 32 sec (25 Hz sampling rate) is listed for each case in units of cm. 
Four columns are labeled "Time," "Case A,"  "Case B," "Case C." 

The surface elevation time series for gages 4 through 10 for cases A, B, and C
are stored in files TS3A.TXT, TS3B.TXT, and TS3C.TXT, respectively.  A total
of 30 sec of data from 265 to 295 sec is included for each case for the seven
gages in units of meters.  The time series were started 5 sec earlier (i.e. 265 sec
vs. 270 sec) as originally requested in the benchmark problem statement to
accommodate the passage of the wave at incident gage #4.  The eight columns
are labeled "Time", "G4_m", "G5_m", etc. 

Gage locations for Benchmark Problem #3 are listed below.  The origin is at the
wavemaker rest position with X positive down the flume and Y positive in the
transverse direction.  All gages were on the longitudinal centerline of the flume
(i.e. halfway across the flume width).

Finally, file RUN3ABC.TXT contains the maximum recorded runup heights for
problem 3 for all three cases.  The five columns are labeled "Case," "Target
H/d," "Actual H/d," "Runup R, cm," and "R/d."
